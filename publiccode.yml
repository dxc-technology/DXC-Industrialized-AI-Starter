    longDescription: |
      If you are a data scientist, working on an algorithm that you would like
      to deploy across the enterprise, DXC's Industrialized AI starter makes it
      easier for you to:


      - Access, clean, and explore raw data

      - Build data pipelines

      - Run AI experiments

      - Publish microservices


      The repository is provided with links to example notebooks for individual
      models. These sample notebooks help to understand on how to use each
      function, what parameters are expected for each function and what will be
      the output of each function in a model.
